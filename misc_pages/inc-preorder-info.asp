<p>Pre-orders are items scattered throughout the site in their appropriate categories. They will ALWAYS be noted in the
    title with "PRE-ORDER". Basically you get a lot more control over the item you want and its top quality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Majority of pre-orders are sent to the manufacturers weekly, but there are some companies that are placed every other
    week.
</p>
<p>Pre-order time frames are not chosen by Bodyartforms, but are given to us by each manufacturer on how long it will
    take them to complete our orders.&nbsp; The time frame varies depending on the manufacturer and each pre-order item
    will have the estimated time frame listed on the item page.
    <strong>All time frames are subject to change without notice. </strong>The time frames are on how long it takes the
    piece
    to be made and it does not include shipping time.</strong>
</p>
<p>Your
    <strong>ENTIRE ORDER</strong> will be held until we receive all your items. If you want the other items to come
    before the
    pre-order item then you need to
    <strong>PLACE A SEPERATE ORDER</strong>. Picking express or priority mail will not get your pre-order item to you
    faster,
    it will only speed up the process AFTER we get your item and ship your order out. Once we receive a complete order,
    we will ship the order out within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Once an order has been placed with a manufacturer, we are UNABLE TO MAKE ANY CHANGES! Please double check your specs
    and that you order the correct size beforehand.</p>
<p>If you want to cancel, remove or change a pre-order item there will be a
    <strong>15% restocking fee on each item</strong> because we cannot stop the pieces from being made, nor can we
    return them
    to the manufacturer.</p>
