		Jewelry material information &amp; care
</div>

	<h4> <a name="316L Stainless Steel"></a>316L 
	Stainless Steel </h4>
	316L steel is the most basic metal used in 
	body jewelry. It is the basic requirement of metal to be used 
	in initial piercings and for healing. There are better grades 
	(below) but usually they cost more as well. For most people this 
	grade of steel works just fine.
	<ul>
	<li> Solid steel jewelry CAN 
	be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li>If the steel jewelry also has acrylic DO 
	NOT use alcohol or harsh chemicals to clean it. It will ruin 
	the acrylic.</li>
	<li>If the steel jewelry has gems on it DO 
	NOT use alcohol or harsh chemicals to clean it. It could eat 
	away the glue that holds them in place. Better pieces of jewelry 
	will have the gem bezel set in it (not held in by glue). These 
	pieces cost significantly more but are well worth the money.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4><a name="316LVM ASTM F-138 Implant Grade Steel"></a>316LVM 
	ASTM F-138 Implant Grade Steel</h4>

	This grade of steel is top of the line. It is highly recommended, but it 
	comes down to a personal preference on whether you want 
	to pay a little bit more for the best. Lots of people are fine to 
	use the basic 316L steel, but for some people with extremely sensitive 
	skin, getting the top grade of steel usually helps. 
	   
	<ul>
	<li> Solid steel jewelry CAN 
	be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>
	<a name="Titanium"></a><a name="Grade 5 titanium"></a><a name="Titanium 6AL4VELI ASTM F-136 implant grade"></a>Titanium</h4>

	Titanium is usually preferred over steel because 
	it contains no nickel and it weighs almost 50% less than steel. 
	Titanium can come in plain polish which looks just like steel 
	AND it can come in a variety of colors (but NOT red or black). 
	Titanium is super for people with sensitive skin to steel. It 
	does cost a little more but is well worth it. Titanium comes in 
	different grades just like steel with Grade 23 (6AL4V ELI F-136) 
	implant grade being the highest. Colored titanium does fade over 
	time (but is not dangerous to your piercing). If worn in the mouth 
	the color usually fades faster.
	<ul>
	<li> Solid titanium jewelry 
	CAN be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li>No need to use alcohol or harsh cleansers 
	on your jewelry</li>
	</ul>

	
	
	<h4><a name="Acrylic"></a><a name="FDA approved acrylic"></a><a name="Lucite"></a>Acrylic 
	/ Lucite</h4>
	Acrylic jewelry is light weight and great 
	for healed piercings *only*. Acrylic should not be used in new 
	or unhealed piercings. It should also not be used in newly stretched 
	piercings. Be aware that this acrylic when worn in tongue piercings 
	can emit toxins from the plastic. For tongue piercings, dental 
	acrylic is recommended.
	<ul>
	<li> Acrylic cannot be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Acrylic can not be boiled or left in heat/direct sunlight otherwise it risks the possibility of warping</li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water</li>
	<li> DO NOT clean with alcohol 
	or other harsh chemicals as it will ruin the jewelry </li>
	<li> Be careful with your acrylic 
	balls! If you try to thread them down too far the threads 
	can strip. </li>
	<li> Acrylic 
	is very fragile and brittle and will shatter under stress </li>
	<li>Do not leave in 
	direct sunlight or heat as it can warp</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	  <h4><a name="Dental acrylic"></a>Dental 
	acrylic</h4>
	
	Dental acrylic is much stronger AND 
	safer than standard acrylic which most jewelry is made from.

	<ul>
	<li> Dental acrylic CAN be 
	autoclaved (although we have had some pieces change color but they didn't melt) </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water</li>
	<li> DO NOT clean with alcohol 
	or other harsh chemicals as it will ruin the jewelry </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	  <h4><a name="PTFE"></a>PTFE</h4>
	PTFE (Monofilament nylon and teflon) is 
	a 100% safe flexible material that is becoming very popular 
	for surface piercings and also for piercings where more flexibility 
	is needed (the navel during pregnancy or for surgeries). It 
	has a &quot;non-stick&quot; surface and can be used in initial 
	piercings. 
	 

	<ul>
	<li> PTFE can be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water... no need to use alcohol or harsh chemicals. </li>
	</ul>

	
	
	 <h4><a name="Flexible plastic"></a>Flexible 
	plastic</h4>
	Flexible plastic is okay for temporary 
	use. If you're looking for a permanent solution with flexibility 
	you need to use PTFE as it's safer for piercings. Flexible 
	plastic also comes in a variety colors.

	<ul>
	<li> It can NOT be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and 
	warm water... no need to use alcohol or harsh chemicals.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h4><a name="Bioplast"></a>Bioplast</h4>
	
	Direct from the manufacturers website:According to the current state of knowledge BioplastT conforms to all world wide standards on use of body jewellery materials.
	<ul>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; is Biocompatible.</li>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; is flexible.</li>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; can be cut to any length and threaded by any metal ball closure.</li>
	<li> People pierced with Bioplast&trade; have less swelling and infections.</li>
	<li> The healing process with Bioplast&trade; is faster than that of other materials.</li>
	<li> No allergic reactions (no nickel)</li>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; can be sterilised by autoclave (up to 121&deg;c.)</li>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; is competitively priced and is available in 8 colours.</li>
	<li> Bioplast&trade; is one of the best materials for initial piercing.</li>
	</ul>
	Although Bioplast&trade; has been tested and judged Biocompatible this does not guarantee its appropriateness for use in all people and due to the complexities of the human body the Bioplast&trade; manufacturer recommends that any one experiencing any sensitivity towards these products remove the jewellery and seek medical advice.
	
	
	<h4><a name="Buffalo Horn"></a><a name="Bone" id="Bone"></a>Water buffalo horn &amp; bone </h4>
	All of our horn comes from animals that are already dead. These animals are not killed for the horn. Horn jewelry is a good way to make sure that all of the animal is respectfully used.
	<ul>
	<li>Clean before wearing. Use mild soap and water quickly. Rinse and dry immediately after washing. </li>
	<li>We recommend taking horn jewelry out before showering, swimming, or water activities.</li>
	<li>Do not soak in anything, including water! </li>
	<li>Lightly 
	oil it with coconut oil or jajoba oil about once a week to help keep 
	it from cracking.</li>
	<li>Every once in a while it could a polish. If you have a polishing cloth it would help to oil it and polish it with the cloth to keep it in good condition and help keep cracking at a minimal. </li>
	<li>Do not store in direct sunlight. Do not store in extreme temperatures or the bathroom.</li>
	<li>Organic jewelry is for healed piercings only. </li>
	<li>Horn jewelry can not be sterilized or autoclaved </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4><a name="Amber" id="Amber"></a>Amber</h4>
	A very helpful article on real vs. synthetic amber can be found at <a href="http://www.ambericawest.com/real_amber.html" target="_blank">Amberica West</a>For body jewelry purposes, real or synthetic amber just comes down to a personal preference. Synthetic is much cheaper and basically looks almost exactly the same. Most body jewelry you find made from &quot;amber&quot; is actually synthetic.
	<ul>
	<li>Do not clean with alcohol or other harsh chemicals. Just clean with simple soap and water.</li>
	<li>Do not expose to excessive heat </li>
	<li>Do not put too much pressure on amber as it can get warped or scatched easily</li>
	<li>Since it is like stone, if you drop it you do risk it chipping, cracking, or possibly breaking. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>About our burmese amber<br />
	All our burmese amber plugs are purchased from one supplier that is very meticulous about a quality product. This is an extremely old type of amber. The new plugs are actually made from tribal peoples' plugs that range anywhere from 80 - 150 years old. The amber is dark with &quot;strings&quot; rather than flaky speckles like you might find in baltic amber. Since it's one of the more rare ambers, it also costs more. But it is extremely beautiful and VERY hard to find. </p>
	
	
	
	<h4><a name="Wood" id="Wood"></a><a name="Coconut wood"></a>Wood (all types) </h4>
	Wood jewelry is light weight, natural, and comes in a variety of types/colors. As long as the surface is sanded/polished very smooth, it should be comfortable to wear. It is porous and does absorb moisture from the skin so keeping it oiled daily with natural oils (jajoba, vitamin E) will help.
	<ul>
	<li> Wood jewelry should only be worn in healed piercings.</li>
	<li>Keep your wood jewelry oiled to keep in good condition, and  from cracking. You can use jajoba oil, coconut oil, or any other natural plant oil. </li>
	<li>Try not to get wood jewelry wet (shower, swimming, etc) for extended amounts of time. Best thing to do is just take it out during these activities and then put it back in afterwards.</li>
	<li>From time to time you should wipe your plugs down with a damp wash cloth. Pat them dry, and re-oil them before wearing them.</li>
	<li>Over time the grain of wood can &quot;raise up&quot; so you may need to re-sand it with 800 grit sandpaper and then buffed with 1200 grit sandpaper. </li>
	<li>Avoid leaving your wood jewelry in direct sunlight. </li>
	<li>Wood can not be autoclaved or sterilized.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h4><a name="Stone" id="Stone"></a>Stone</h4>
	Stone comes in a variety of colors and the weight varies depending on what type of stone it is.
	<ul>
	<li>Stone jewelry should only be worn in healed piercings.</li>
	<li>Use a mild soap and luke warm water to clean then dry afterwards.</li>
	<li>Be careful to not drop on hard surfaces as it could break.</li>
	<li>Stone jewelry can NOT be sterilized.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h4><a name="Pyrex Glass"></a>Pyrex 
	glass</h4>
	Pyrex glass is a great alternative to steel 
	or titanium (though not as strong) and you can get all kinds of cool colors/designs in it! 
	It contains no nickel and is extremely sturdy. Pyrex is basically 
	kiln annealed (heated) to make it as strong as it can be. Keep in mind that ANY glass  will never be as strong as steel or titanium. Eyelets will be more fragile than solid glass plugs. Small gauges have more of a risk of breaking as well. When wearing ANY glass always keep in mind that it *could* break if hit or dropped and then you'll possibly have to deal with glass shards. It's rare that pyrex does break,  but it CAN happen (after all, it IS glass).
	<ul>
	<li> Pyrex jewelry CAN be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and warm 
	water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li>Obviously, be careful not to drop it on the 
	floor or on a hard surface. After all it STILL is glass!</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4><a name="Quartz Glass"></a>Quartz glass</h4>
	
	From Glasswear Studios: <br />
	Quartz Glass is similar to Pyrex with a few differences. 1) Stronger, 2) higher melting temperature, 3) Higher resistant to thermal cracking, 4) refracts light better 5) available in smaller gauges 6) available in clear only. Even though it is quartz, it is still fragile and will break if forced to bend. Do not bite down on it or try to bend it. This jewelry is for retainer use only. Not recommended for sports activities. 100% Hypoallergenic, a great alternative to plastic which is porous. It is 99.98% Pure silica (SiO2), Made from the purest sand on earth.

	<ul>
	<li> Quartz jewelry CAN be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and warm water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li>Obviously, be careful not to drop it on the floor or on a hard surface. After all it STILL is glass!</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h4><a name="Silicon"></a><a name="Silicone"></a>Silicone</h4>
	Implant grade silicone is entirely safe for body piercing use and is great for people with metal allergies or sensitivities.
	<ul>
	<li>Wash with antibacterial soap and warm water before inserting into your piercing. </li>
	<li>Use lubricant before inserting or removing silicone eyelets/plugs. This will help reduce chance of tearing. </li>
	<li>Silicone jewelry CAN be autoclaved.</li>
	<li>Never soak in or use  harsh chemicals such as alcohol.</li>
	<li>Silicone is not recommended to stretch your piercing. It has been done successfully, but not in all cases. If you want to take the chance and go for it, that's fine. Just be aware that your body could BADLY react to it. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4><a name="Latex"></a>Latex</h4>
	Latex is a form of rubber. Keep latex away from oils  as it destroys it. Avoid excess heat, sun, or humidity which can discolor and degrade latex.        
	
	<h4><a name="Niobium"></a>Niobium</h4>Niobium is an elemental metal (not man made) 
	and is slightly heavier than 316L stainless steel. If you are 
	allergic to stainless steel, niobium is a good alternative, 
	but most people prefer titanium because it is much lighter and 
	about the same price. Niobium is also the only metal that can 
	be colored black through a heating process, and is still proven 
	to be safe.
	<ul>
	<li> Solid niobium jewelry CAN 
	be autoclaved </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and warm 
	water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4><a name="14k gold"></a><a name="18k gold"></a>Gold </h4>
	Only 14k or 18k gold is appropriate 
	for body jewelry (24k gold is too soft). 14k is the best as it is strong enough to 
	maintain the threads for barbell etc. The higher grade of gold, 
	the softer it gets. Lower grades than 14k could result in migration, 
	rejection, or develop permanent reactions to gold.
	<ul>
	<li> Do not clean with alcohol 
	or other harsh chemicals </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and warm 
	water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li> Be gentle when screwing on 
	balls as threads could easily strip </li>
	<li>Over time gold can lose its luster from 
	being within the body. All you need to do is lightly buff it back 
	to its natural shine.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4><a name="Gold plated steel"></a>Gold 
	plated steel </h4>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating" target="_blank">Read 
	a scientific detailed article at Wikipedia</a> about the electroplating 
	process.
	
	
	<h4>  <a name="Silver"></a>Sterling 
	silver </h4>   Silver should never be worn in new or unhealed 
	piercings. It is safe to wear in healed piercings, but not for every day wear (every day for long periods). Silver can tarnish  and when worn in a 
	new piercing, the tarnish can be deposited into the skin causing 
	it to darken or turn gray. Silver 
	is very soft and is easily scratched.  If you have a nickel allergy, do not wear sterling silver.
	<ul>
	<li> Do not clean with alcohol 
	or other harsh chemicals </li>
	<li>Simply wash with antibacterial soap and warm 
	water before inserting into your piercing</li>
	<li>Over time silver can tarnish (turn brown 
	colored). All you need to do is lightly buff it back to its natural 
	shine.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4> <a name="PVD plated steel"></a><a name="PVD plated titanium"></a>PVD 
	coated steel or titanium </h4>
	Physical vapor deposition (PVD) describes a variety of vacuum deposition methods which can be used to produce thin films and coatings. PVD is characterized by a process in which the material goes from a condensed phase to a vapor phase and then back to a thin film condensed phase.  It is an outer coating over a base metal (titanium or steel). This jewelry is fine for autoclaving or 
	steam sterilization treatments.
	<ul>
	<li>PVD coated jewelry will fade and  possibly 
	chip over time.</li>
	<li>If you wear PVD coated jewerly in an oral piercing, the chances of it fading or chipping will be MUCH quicker than other piercings. Oral jewelry gets a lot of wear and depending on the person, the saliva can have a different effect on the coating. With some people it may be fine, with others it could start fading in a week. This can also happen from the jewelry being &quot;clicked&quot; on the teeth, rubbed, or chewed/bitten. </li>
	<li> Do not use alcohol 
	or harsh chemicals to clean jewelry. Just use standard antibacterial 
	soap and warm water to clean jewelry. </li>
	</ul>

		<h4><a name="Cobalt-Chrome"></a>Cobalt-Chrome</h4>
		<a class="mb-1 d-block" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt-chrome" target="_blank">Link to WikiPedia</a>
		Cobalt-chrome or cobalt-chromium (CoCr) is a metal alloy of cobalt and chromium. Cobalt-chrome has a very high specific strength and is commonly used in dental implants and orthopedic implants.<br><br>
		Co-Cr alloys are most commonly used to make artificial joints including knee and hip joints due to high wear-resistance and biocompatibility. Co-Cr alloys tend to be corrosion resistant, which reduces complication with the surrounding tissues when implanted, and chemically inert that they minimize the possibility of irritation, allergic reaction, and immune response.
